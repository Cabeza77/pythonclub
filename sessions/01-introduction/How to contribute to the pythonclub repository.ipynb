    "## How to fork and clone the Github repository\n",
    "\n",
    "We will adopt the **fork and branch** Git Workflow. The **fork and branch** workflow is a common way of collaborating on open source projects using [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the **fork and branch** workflow looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fork a GitHub repository.\n",
    "- Clone the forked repository to your local system.\n",
    "- Add a Git remote for the original repository.\n",
    "- Create a feature branch in which to place your changes.\n",
    "- Make your changes to the new branch.\n",
    "- Commit the changes to the branch.\n",
    "- Push the branch to GitHub.\n",
    "- Open a pull request from the new branch to the original repo.\n",
    "- Clean up after your pull request is merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the steps you need to follow to fork the respository and clone the forked respository.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com) in your computer and create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the web browser and visit the link <https://github.com/pucdata/pythonclub>  \n",
    "   Click the icon Fork located in the top-right of the window\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Create a folder in your computer for storing all your Github repositories. We recommed creating the folder Github in your HOME. Open the terminal and execute the following commands.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd ~\n",
    "mkdir Github\n",
    "cd Github\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup a couple of Github parameters.\n",
    "   Replace vim with your favorite editor, YOUR_NAME with your Name and YOUR_EMAIL with your email address  \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git config credential.helper store\n",
    "git config --global core.editor \"vim\"\n",
    "git config --global push.default current\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"YOUR_NAME\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"YOUR_EMAIL\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the pythonclub repository from the Github server to your local computer (origin).\n",
    "   Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your Github username. \n",
    "   Add a Git remote for the original repository (upstream).\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/pythonclub.git  \n",
    "cd pythonclub  \n",
    "git remote add upstream https://github.com/pucdata/pythonclub.git  \n",
    "git fetch --all  \n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let’s say you want to create a tutorial about **astropy**. The best way is to create a branch from master and develop the new code on that branch. Let’s call the branch **astropy**.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git checkout -b astropy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Now you are in the *astropy* branch and you can add any content you want. Even you can modify files that were already in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For tracking the new files you need to use **git add**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For commiting the changes you need to use **git commit**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Replace TYPE_A_LOG_MESSAGE by a short message describing the changes\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git add -A\n",
    "git commit -m \"TYPE_A_LOG_MESSAGE\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Push the changes to to your own fork of the project and the pull request for the topic branch you've just pushed\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```"
